### Project Summary

This is the first version of the Agenda Management System that was built in collaboration with Miami-Dade County's IT Department for Florida International University's CIS 4911 - Senior Project Course. The main purpose of the application in its current state is to streamline the creation, editing, and viewing of agenda items through use of role based actions and version control. It also supports the naive and advanced searching of agenda items for quick lookups. Users of the application have restricted actions based on roles, and the application has a basic authentication flow to ensure data is never accessed by unauthorized users.
